The command line makes our life so much easier since we can automate several mundane tasks and make things run smoother. Instead of clicking around in the Graphical User Interface _(GUI),_ we can fire off a couple of commands and call it job done.

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

Every Linux or Mac-based operating system has a command-line installed by default, usually under the name “Terminal.” The command line _(CLI)_ lets us easily move and rename files, sort through data, and navigate around the computer.

Without further ado, here are 11 command line tricks that will make your life easier.

---

# 1\. grep

```
$ grep "some string" file
```

The grep command searches for patterns in each file. It also looks for patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.

The _-i_ option enables us to search for a string case-insensitively in the given file. It matches words like “REACT,” “REact,” and “react.”

```
$ grep -i "REact" file
```

We can find the number of lines that matches the given string/pattern with the _-c_ _(count)_ flag.

```
$ grep -c "react" index.js
```

Here’s a fun and an educational comic about the _grep_ command I found on the internet.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*ZkpszLnLQFRFp_cVO_Ldmw.jpeg)

In addition, the variant programs _egrep_ and _fgrep_ are the same as  
_grep -E_ and _grep -F_, respectively. These variants are deprecated,  
but are provided for backward compatibility.

You can do a lot with _grep_— read the documentation for an in-depth dive [here](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html).

# 2\. ls

```
$ ls
```

_ls_ lists files and directories in the current active path. If the _pathname_ is a file, _ls_ displays information on the file according to the requested options. If the _pathname_ is a directory, ls displays information on the files and subdirectories therein.

You might have noticed the files are being shown as a grey color, while the folders are blueish. This is to help us make a distinction between folders and files.

---

# 3\. pwd

```
$ pwd
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1748/1*E1zXuIQ6X0aaTtVC0wZ_nw.png)

The _pwd_ command is a command-line utility for printing the current working directory. The output will print the full system path of the current working directory to standard output. By default, the _pwd_ command ignores symlinks, although the full physical path of a current directory can be shown with an option.

---

# 4\. cat

```
$ cat somefile.js
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2144/1*SL7g1NHsb7dKgwmoYBySkQ.png)

The _cat_ command has three related functions with regard to a text file:

- Displaying them
- Combining copies
- Creating new ones

The most common use of cat is to read the contents of files, and _cat_ is often the most convenient program for this purpose.

In the following example, the standard output of cat is redirected using the output redirection operator (which is represented by a rightward pointing angular bracket) to file2:

```
$ cat somefile > somefile2
```

---

# 5\. echo

```
$ echo "some text"
```

The _echo_ command in Linux is used to display a line of text/string that’s passed as an argument. The _echo_ is a built-in command that’s mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2088/1*1bMjVqwhueQP5hvyMMdDKA.png)

---

# 6\. touch

```
$ touch somefile
```

The _touch_ command is used to create a file without any content. The _touch_ command can be used when the user doesn’t have data to store at the time of file creation.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1528/1*RIrUCSW4TT_cJrnGy9ighQ.png)

Notice how we’re using _touch_ to create the file and _cat_ to look inside the file. Since the newly created _index2.js_ file is empty, the cat returns nothing.

Here are the main differences between _cat_ and*touch*:

- _cat_— Used to create the file with the content.
- _touch_— Creates a file without any content or empty files. Remember, the file created using _touch_ command is empty. This command is useful when the user doesn’t have data to store at the time of file creation.

# 7\. mkdir

```
$ mkdir some-directory
```

As you guessed it, mkdir creates a new empty directory in the current active path. Instead of clicking around in your text editor or GUI, use this command to create new folders.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2184/1*FsxDBW5HDWJn9kHsw0My7A.png)

_Note:_ Notice how we can peek inside the directory with the previous _ls_ command.

## 7.1 rm

```
$ rm someFile
```

Rm stands for remove, which does exactly what it says it does. Removes, or in other words, deletes a file.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2148/1*damLEKdyWY7aBPILFELVNg.png)

By default, the _rm_ command doesn’t remove directories. You need to pass the _-rf_ flag to remove directories.

```
$ rm -rf some-directory
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2272/1*gXTLAllsEVTdWHCcDw83WQ.png)

_Note:_ This removes the directory unconditionally, whether the directory has content inside or not.

## 7.2 rmdir

```
$ rmdir some-directory
```

The _rmdir_ command removes the directory if there’s no content inside the directory.

# 8\. tail

```
$ tail somefile
```

The _tail_ command reads a file and outputs the last part of it (the “tail”).

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2804/1*Xvo2zdyDZqj4QhTHF0TLTg.png)

The _tail_ command is useful when going through crash reports or previous history logs. Here’s an example of its usefulness when working with file logs.

```
# tail /var/log/messages

# 9\. wget

```
$ wget someurl
```

GNU Wget is a [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw) package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS — the most widely-used internet protocols. It’s a non-interactive command-line tool, so it may easily be called from scripts, CRON jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/1*nbzEhCeVUxT2-Px0oQbszQ.png)

GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring entire web or FTP sites easy, including:

- Can resume aborted downloads using REST and RANGE
- Can use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
- NLS-based message files for many different languages
- Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative so that downloaded documents may link to each other locally
- Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows
- Supports HTTP proxies
- Supports HTTP cookies
- Supports persistent HTTP connections
- Unattended / background operation
- Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be re-downloaded when mirroring
- GNU Wget is distributed under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

Read the [official GNU documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for more information.

# 10\. find

```
$ find path -name filename
```

The _find_ command lets you quickly lookup a file or directory. It’s useful when you’re working on a big project with hundreds of files and multiple directories.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1696/1*j291SZcYXSaPtdvqipX6sg.png)

## Search for files of a particular type

The _find_ command also lets you search for the same type of files in a directory (and its subdirectories). For example, the following command will search for all _.js_ files in your current working directory.

```
$ find . -name "*.js"
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1992/1*_i8_TEIElXAAyXy-F1JQmA.png)

---

# 11\. mv

```
$ mv somefile /to/some/other/path
```

The _mv_ command moves files or directories from one place to another. The _mv_ command supports moving single files, multiple files, and directories.
