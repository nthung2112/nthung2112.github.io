#### Normal Function Call

To explain what `new` does, let’s start with just a normal function, called without `new`. We want to write a function that will create “person” objects. It’ll give these objects `name` and `age` properties based on parameters that it takes in.

```javascript
function personFn(name, age) {
  var personObj = {};
  personObj.name = name;
  personObj.age = age;

  return personObj;
}
var alex = personFn('Alex', 30);
// -> { name: 'Alex', age: 30 }
```

Simple enough. We create an object, add the properties to it, and return it at the end.

#### `new`

Let’s create a function that does the same thing, but we want it to be invoked using `new`. This function will create the same object as the one above. Common practice is to make functions that are meant to be invoked with `new` start with a capital letter. These functions are also referred to as **constructors**.

```javascript
function PersonConstructor(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
var alex = new PersonConstructor('Alex', 30);
// -> { name: 'Alex', age: 30 }
```

Invoking `personFn` normally and invoking `PersonConstructor` with `new` both result in the same object being created. What’s going on?

The `new` keyword invokes a function in a special way. It adds some implicit code that we don’t see. Let’s expand the above function to show everything that’s happening. The commented lines are pseudocode representing functionality that is implicitly added by the JS engine when using `new`.

```javascript
function PersonConstructor(name, age) {
  // this = {};
  // this.__proto__ = PersonConstructor.prototype;
  // Set up logic such that: if
  // there is a return statement
  // in the function body that
  // returns anything EXCEPT an
  // object, array, or function:
  //     return 'this' (the newly
  //     constructed object)
  //     instead of that item at
  //     the return statement;
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  // return this;
}
```

Let’s break it down. `new`:

1.  Creates a new object and binds it to the `this` keyword.
2.  Sets the object’s internal [[[Prototype]]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto), [property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto), [\_\_proto\_\_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto), to be the prototype of the constructing function. This also makes it so the [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor) of the new object is prototypically inherited.
3.  Sets up logic such that if a variable of any type other than `object`, `array`, or `function` is returned in the function body, return `this`, the newly constructed object, instead of what the function says to return.
4.  At the end of the function, returns `this` if there is no return statement in the function body.

Let’s show that these statements are valid, one by one.

```javascript
function Demo() {
  console.log(this);
  this.value = 5;
  return 10;
}
/*1*/ var demo = new Demo(); // -> {}
/*2*/ console.log(demo.__proto__ === Demo.prototype); // -> true
console.log(demo.constructor === Demo); // -> true
/*3*/ console.log(demo); // -> { value: 5 }
function SecondDemo() {
  this.val = '2nd demo';
}
/*4*/ console.log(new SecondDemo()); // -> { val: '2nd demo' }
```

If you aren’t familiar with constructors or prototypes, don’t worry about it too much. You’ll run into them as you continue to learn Javascript. For now, just understand that the new object implicitly returned by the constructor function will be able to inherit properties and methods.

#### Calling a non-constructor with new

What happens if we invoke a normal function like `personFn` using `new`? Nothing special. The same rules apply. in the case of `personFn`, we see nothing explicitly happening.

```javascript
var alex = new personFn('Alex', 30);
// -> { name: 'Alex', age: 30 }
```

Why? Let’s add our implicit code in to `personFn`.

```javascript
function personFn(name, age) {
  // this = {};
  // this.constructor = PersonConstructor;
  // this.__proto__ = PersonConstructor.prototype;
  // Set up logic such that: if
  // there is a return statement
  // in the function body that
  // returns anything EXCEPT an
  // object, array, or function:
  //     return this (the newly
  //     constructed object)
  //     instead of that item at
  //     the return statement;
  var personObj = {};
  personObj.name = name;
  personObj.age = age;

  return personObj;

  // return this;
}
```

The implicit code is still added in:

- It binds `this` to a new object and sets its constructor and prototype.
- It adds logic that will return `this` instead of a non-object.
- It adds an implicit `return this` statement at the end.

This doesn’t affect our code, since we don’t use the `this` keyword in our code. We also explicitly return an object, `personObj`, so the returning logic and the `return this` line have no use. Effectively, using `new` to invoke our function here has no effect on the output. If we were using `this` or if we weren’t returning an object, the function would have different effects when invoked with and without `new`.

#### That’s it. Go write some code.
