Aloha, web surfer. So perhaps you‚Äôre a `let` fan who came here to see what was up. Or maybe you‚Äôre a beginner, just moving out of `var` town and into the wild west that is ES6 variable declaration. Whatever your experience level may be, I hope this article provides valuable insights and leaves you with a solid rule of thumb for instantiating variables in Javascript. My other hope is that, upon finishing this article, you can confidently part ways with `var` ‚Äì it is time.

### Once Upon A Time‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶in a specification authored somewhere in California‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶a keyword for variable instantiation was created and called `var`.

If you remember your first day learning Javascript, it probably involved `var`. This little keyword was our only option for declaring variables in Javascript for a long time. In fact, every web site and application that used Javascript between it‚Äôs inception in 1995 and the release of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) used `var` and only `var` to create variables. (Someone fact check me on this statement, but I think it‚Äôs accurate.)

The `var` keyword is no longer relevant, but in order to truly understand our present, we must understand our past.

Some important things to know about variables created with the `var` keyword:

```
1) They are function scoped
2) Their declarations get hoisted
3) They can be declared without a value

```

#### 1 ‚ÄúThey are function scoped‚Äù

This means that `var` creates a variable that only exists inside of the function where it was declared.

_(Unless it was not declared inside a function. In that case, it exists ~everywhere~ üò≤. More on this in fact #3.)_

Here‚Äôs a code snippet that illustrates the behavior of a function scoped variable:

```javascript
function logA() {
  var a = 2;
  console.log(a); // inside of `logA()`, `a` exists with value 2
}

console.log(a); // ReferenceError! Outside of logA(), `a` is not defined.
```

I think it‚Äôs worth clarifying that when I say ‚Äúinside of‚Äù `logA()`, I mean ‚Äúbetween `logA()`‚Äôs curly brackets‚Äù.

#### 2 ‚ÄúTheir declarations get hoisted‚Äù üèã

Variable hoisting basically boils down to the fact that a variable declared with `var` can be instantiated _after_ it gets used.

This code‚Ä¶

```javascript
function logB() {
  b = 2; // using b to hold the number 2
  console.log(b); // using b to print 2 in the console

  var b; // instantiating b ü§î
}
```

‚Ä¶will get transformed into something like this code‚Ä¶

```javascript
function logB() {
  var b; // instantiation is hoisted to the top of logB()'s scope

  b = 2;
  console.log(b);
}
```

‚Ä¶at _compile_ time (yes, [Javascript gets compiled](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/31e1d4ff600d88cc2ce243903ab8a3a9d15cce15/scope%20%26%20closures/ch1.md)). That‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt matter (to the browser) where we instantiate our variables ‚Äì the declarations get to skip the line every time.

There‚Äôs a dark side to the way `var` gets hoisted, though. Javascript‚Äôs compiler can be a bit _too_ helpful in some situations.

If we use a variable within a function but don‚Äôt instantiate the variable in that function, the compiler will look for a `var` in the parent function scope. If it doesn‚Äôt find it there, it will keep looking all the way up the scope chain until it gets to the _global_ scope. If it _still_ doesn‚Äôt see a `var` declaration up there, it will just go ahead and _make one for you_, as demonstrated in this snippet:

```javascript
function logC() {
  c = 2;
  console.log(c); // 2
}
// c is not instantiated in this program, yet it just works...
```

Yikes.

I guess this could be convenient sometimes when messing around in a REPL or something‚Ä¶

But for the most part, this is bananas. `"use strict";` prevents this and should be included at the top of any ES5 script.

#### 3 ‚ÄúThey can be declared without a value‚Äù

You may have seen someone do something along these lines before:

```javascript
// declare all my variables at the top of the script
var a, b, c;

// use them down here
a = 1;
b = 2;
c = a + b;
```

Put a pin in this because it becomes important later.

### Times Have Changed

The three facets of `var` that I just covered come together to create an extremely flexible variable declaration mechanism. While flexibility itself is not a bad thing and having only one variable instantiation keyword means a little more flexibility is necessary, `var` is simply doing too much. Function scope isn‚Äôt a problem, but reassigning variables is so-so and should only be used for `for` loops and times when it‚Äôs completely unavoidable (and when it‚Äôs unavoidable, it probably means we have bigger fish to fry). The same goes for declaring variables without values. Lastly, being allowed to use a variable whether we declared it or not is silly.

So, in order to address these drawbacks of `var` and save us developers from the pitfalls these ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù features can cause, the ES6 specification introduced two new variable keywords: `const` and `let`.

Remember, the primary goal of this post is to show that it‚Äôs time to ditch `var`. Times have changed and `var` doesn‚Äôt make the cut.

### Let me explain‚Ä¶

In 2015, Javascript‚Äôs variable declaration family grew to include `let`, which deviates significantly from `var` in that it is _block_ scoped. This basically means that we now have two units of scope available:

#### 1 Functions

```javascript
function() {
  let i = 'aye'; // `i` is scoped to this function
  console.log(i); // "aye"
}
console.log(i); // ReferenceError

```

#### 2 Blocks

```javascript
{
  let i = 'oi'; // `i` is scoped to this block
  console.log(i); // "oi"
}
console.log(i); // ReferenceError
```

The `let` keyword has another helpful constraint: the variable cannot be accessed _before_ its declaration (`let` [does get hoisted](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31219420/are-variables-declared-with-let-or-const-not-hoisted-in-es6) though).

One thing `let` shares with `var` is that it can be used to declare a variable without an initial value. Like in the example above, we could have done

```javascript
{
  let i;
  i = 'oi';
}
```

and it would‚Äôve worked.

### Const stop, won‚Äôt stop

Okay, `const` is my favorite variable declaration keyword in Javascript. I default to `const` over `let` and never use `var`. As a rule, I always use `const` unless I _have_ to use `let`.

Remember how variables declared with `var` can be instantiated with empty values? This type of instantiation is allowed with `let`, too. It is not so with `const`. Oh no, `const` requires that you provide a value up front. Otherwise, it will turn its nose up at you and refuse to create a variable, _‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going in the variable, monsieur/madame, then why do you need it at all?‚Äù_ ‚Äì this is good.

But there‚Äôs more! `const` goes one step further and ensures that the variable cannot be reassigned [**note:** this does not mean the variable is _immutable_]. For example,

```javascript
const a = 'ay';
a = 2; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

Comparing `const` to `var`:

1 `const` is block scoped, `var` is function scoped. 2 `const` has to be instantiated _with_ a value, `var` does not 3 `const` cannot be reassigned, `var` can 4 `const` cannot be accessed prior to instantiation, `var` can

So basically `const` is the strictest variable instantiation tool we have at our disposal. The constraints it provides protect us from several possible errors, making the development process smoother.

### Exceptions: When to use `let`

While I recommend defaulting to `const`, some situations demand the use of `let`.

Here is a quote by Eric Elliot from a [great article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-es6-var-let-or-const-ba58b8dcde75) he wrote about the three keywords:

```javascript
`let`, is a signal that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm. It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it‚Äôs defined in, which is not always the entire containing function.

```

In other words, `for` loops and mathematical algorithms are the only times we would need to reach for `let`. Other than that, `const` is the strongest, safest bet.

### Use const until you have to use let

I hope this article helped you on your quest to understand `let` and `const` and how they differ from `var`. I also hope you can comfortably ditch `var` and use `const` until you have to use `let`. I‚Äôm still learning myself and there are certainly gaps in this article. Feel free to correct me when I‚Äôm wrong or bring missing information to light.
