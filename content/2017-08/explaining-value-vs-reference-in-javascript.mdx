Dùng một cái nhìn đơn giản của bộ nhớ máy tính giải thích điều này

Javascript có 5 kiểu dữ liệu được thông qua **_value_**: `Boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `String`, và `Number`. Chúng ta sẽ gọi chung là **primitive types**.

Javascript có 5 kiểu dữ liệu được thông qua **_reference_**: `Array`, `Function`, và `Object`. Về mặt kỹ thuật đó là Objects, vì vậy chúng ta sẽ đề cập đến chúng chung chung như **Objects**.

### Primitives (Nguyên thủy)

Nếu một kiểu nguyên thủy được gán cho một biến, chúng ta có thể nghĩ rằng biến đó _chứa đựng_ giá trị nguyên thủy.

```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 'abc';
var z = null;
```

`x` _chứa đựng_ `10`. `y` _chứa đựng_ `'abc'`. Để củng cố ý tưởng này, chúng tôi sẽ cung cấp một hình ảnh về những gì các biến này và các giá trị tương ứng giống như trong bộ nhớ.

Khi chúng ta gán các biến này cho các biến khác sử dụng dấu `=`, Chúng ta **copy** giá trị cho biến mới. Chúng được sao chép theo giá trị.

```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 'abc';
var a = x;
var b = y;
console.log(x, y, a, b); // -> 10, 'abc', 10, 'abc'
```

Cả `a` và `x` bây giờ chứa `10`. Cả `b` và `y` bây giờ chứa `'abc'`. Chúng là tách biệt, vì các giá trị được sao chép.

Khi thay đổi một biến nó không thay đổi cái khác. Hãy suy nghĩ là các biến như không có mối quan hệ với nhau.

```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 'abc';
var a = x;
var b = y;

a = 5;
b = 'def';
console.log(x, y, a, b); // -> 10, 'abc', 5, 'def'
```

### Objects

This will feel confusing, but bear with me and read through it. Once you get through it, it’ll seem easy.

Variables that are assigned a non-primitive value are given a _reference_ to that value. That reference points to the object’s location in memory. The variables don’t actually contain the value.

Objects are created at some location in your computer’s memory. When we write `arr = []`, we’ve created an array in memory. What the variable `arr` receives is the address, the location, of that array.

Let’s pretend that `address` is a new data type that is passed by value, just like `number` or `string`. An `address` points to the location, in memory, of a value that is passed by reference. Just like a string is denoted by quotation marks (`''` or `""`), an `address` will be denoted by arrow brackets, `<>`.

When we assign and use a reference-type variable, what we write and see is:

```javascript
1) var arr = [];
2) arr.push(1);
```

A representation of lines 1 and 2 above in memory is:

1.

2.

Notice that the value, the address, contained by the variable `arr` is static. The array in memory is what changes. When we use `arr` to do something, such as pushing a value, the Javascript engine goes to the location of `arr` in memory and works with the information stored there.

#### Assigning by Reference

When a reference type value, an object, is copied to another variable using `=`, the address of that value is what’s actually copied over as if it were a primitive. **Objects are copied by reference** instead of by value.

```javascript
var reference = [1];
var refCopy = reference;
```

The code above looks like this in memory.

Each variable now contains a reference to the _same array_. That means that if we alter `reference`, `refCopy` will see those changes:

```javascript
reference.push(2);
console.log(reference, refCopy); // -> [1, 2], [1, 2]
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RFrFRXIperg0yTwXauc97w.png)

We’ve pushed `2` into the array in memory. When we use `reference` and `refCopy`, we’re pointing to that same array.

#### Reassigning a Reference

Reassigning a reference variable replaces the old reference.

```javascript
var obj = { first: 'reference' };
```

In memory:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PWGp9d2zZ_QGg18HXBSq9Q.png)

When we have a second line:

```javascript
var obj = { first: 'reference' };
obj = { second: 'ref2' };
```

The address stored in `obj` changes. The first object is still present in memory, and so is the next object:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1h73Wn9IyaiXbhxhmJZmYA.png)

When there are no references to an object remaining, as we see for the address `#234` above, the Javascript engine can perform garbage collection. This just means that the programmer has lost all references to the object and can’t use the object any more, so the engine can go ahead and safely delete it from memory. In this case, the object `{ first: 'reference' }` is no longer accessible and is available to the engine for garbage collection.

### == and ===

When the equality operators, `==` and `===`, are used on reference-type variables, they check the reference. If the variables contain a reference to the same item, the comparison will result in `true`.

```javascript
var arrRef = [’Hi!’];
var arrRef2 = arrRef;console.log(arrRef === arrRef2); // -> true
```

If they’re distinct objects, even if they contain identical properties, the comparison will result in `false`.

```javascript
var arr1 = ['Hi!'];
var arr2 = ['Hi!'];
console.log(arr1 === arr2); // -> false
```

If we have two distinct objects and want to see if their properties are the same, the easiest way to do so is to turn them both into strings and then compare the strings. When the equality operators are comparing primitives, they simply check if the values are the same.

```javascript
var arr1str = JSON.stringify(arr1);
var arr2str = JSON.stringify(arr2);
console.log(arr1str === arr2str); // true
```

Another option would be to recursively loop through the objects and make sure each of the properties are the same.

### Passing Parameters through Functions

When we pass primitive values into a function, the function copies the values into its parameters. It’s effectively the same as using `=`.

```javascript
var hundred = 100;
var two = 2;
function multiply(x, y) {
  // PAUSE
  return x * y;
}
var twoHundred = multiply(hundred, two);
```

In the example above, we give `hundred` the value `100`. When we pass it into `multiply`, the variable `x` gets that value, `100`. The value is copied over as if we used an `=` assignment. Again, the value of `hundred` is not affected. Here is a snapshot of what the memory looks like right at the PAUSE comment line in `multiply`.

#### Pure Functions

We refer to functions that don’t affect anything in the outside scope as _pure functions_. As long as a function only takes primitive values as parameters and doesn’t use any variables in its surrounding scope, it is automatically pure, as it can’t affect anything in the outside scope. All variables created inside are garbage-collected as soon as the function returns.

A function that takes in an Object, however, can mutate the state of its surrounding scope. If a function takes in an array reference and alters the array that it points to, perhaps by pushing to it, variables in the surrounding scope that reference that array see that change. After the function returns, the changes it makes persist in the outer scope. This can cause undesired side effects that can be difficult to track down.

Many native array functions, including `Array.map` and `Array.filter`, are therefore written as pure functions. They take in an array reference and internally, they copy the array and work with the copy instead of the original. This makes it so the original is untouched, the outer scope is unaffected, and we’re returned a reference to a brand new array.

Let’s go into an example of a pure vs. impure function.

```javascript
function changeAgeImpure(person) {
  person.age = 25;
  return person;
}
var alex = {
  name: 'Alex',
  age: 30,
};

var changedAlex = changeAgeImpure(alex);
console.log(alex); // -> { name: 'Alex', age: 25 }
console.log(changedAlex); // -> { name: 'Alex', age: 25 }
```

This impure function takes in an object and changes the property `age` on that object to be 25\. Because it acts on the reference it was given, it directly changes the object `alex`. Note that when it returns the `person` object, it is returning the exact same object that was passed in. `alex` and `alexChanged` contain the same reference. It’s redundant to return the `person` variable and to store the reference in a new variable.

Let’s look at a pure function.

```javascript
function changeAgePure(person) {
  var newPersonObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
  newPersonObj.age = 25;
  return newPersonObj;
}
var alex = {
  name: 'Alex',
  age: 30,
};

var alexChanged = changeAgePure(alex);
console.log(alex); // -> { name: 'Alex', age: 30 }
console.log(alexChanged); // -> { name: 'Alex', age: 25 }
```

In this function, we use `JSON.stringify` to transform the object we’re passed into a string, and then parse it back into an object with `JSON.parse`. By performing this transformation and storing the result in a new variable, we’ve created a new object. There are other ways to do the same thing such as looping through the original object and assigning each of its properties to a new object, but this way is simplest. The new object has the same properties as the original but it is a distinctly separate object in memory.

When we change the `age` property on this new object, the original is unaffected. This function is now pure. It can’t affect any object outside its own scope, not even the object that was passed in. The new object needs to be returned and stored in a new variable or else it gets garbage collected once the function completes, as the object is no longer in scope.

#### Test Yourself

Value vs. reference is a concept often tested in coding interviews. Try to figure out for yourself what’s logged here.

```javascript
function changeAgeAndReference(person) {
  person.age = 25;
  person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 50,
  };

  return person;
}
var personObj1 = {
  name: 'Alex',
  age: 30,
};

var personObj2 = changeAgeAndReference(personObj1);
console.log(personObj1); // -> ?
console.log(personObj2); // -> ?
```

The function first changes the property `age` on the original object it was passed in. It then reassigns the variable to a brand new object and returns that object. Here’s what the two objects are logged out.

```javascript
console.log(personObj1); // -> { name: 'Alex', age: 25 }
console.log(personObj2); // -> { name: 'John', age: 50 }
```

Remember that assignment through function parameters is essentially the same as assignment with `=`. The variable `person` in the function contains a reference to the `personObj1` object, so initially it acts directly on that object. Once we reassign `person` to a new object, it stops affecting the original.

This reassignment does not change the object that `personObj1` points to in the outer scope. `person` has a new reference because it was reassigned but this reassignment doesn’t change `personObj1`.

An equivalent piece of code to the above block would be:

```javascript
var personObj1 = {
  name: 'Alex',
  age: 30,
};
var person = personObj1;
person.age = 25;

person = {
  name: 'john',
  age: 50,
};

var personObj2 = person;
console.log(personObj1); // -> { name: 'Alex', age: 25 }
console.log(personObj2); // -> { name: 'John', age: '50' }
```

The only difference is that when we use the function, `person` is no longer in scope once the function ends.
