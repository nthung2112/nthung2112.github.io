HTTPS is everywhere and more often than not we need to spin an https server or two. Here's how you can do it for your local express.js dev server:

## 1\. Generate a self-signed certificate

```bash
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert
```

## 2\. Enable HTTPS in Express

Add something like this to your index.js

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var https = require('https');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('hello world');
});

https
  .createServer(
    {
      key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('server.cert'),
    },
    app
  )
  .listen(3000, function () {
    console.log(
      'Example app listening on port 3000! Go to https://localhost:3000/'
    );
  });
```

Now run a command _node index.js_ and your server should be available at address _https://localhost:3000_.

- Note:
  In Chrome, put in chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost in the address bar.
  Enable the option that says "Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost".
  Restart Chrome, and it should allow the site.
